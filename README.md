# 3'UTR Analysis in Breast Cancer 

This repository contains scripts used to examine the 3'UTR (3' untranslated region) in breast cancer. The 3'UTR plays a crucial role in gene regulation, and studying its characteristics can provide valuable insights into breast cancer biology.

## Scripts

The following scripts are included in this repository:

- `official.ipynb`: This script performs various analyses on the 3'UTR sequences of breast cancer-related genes. It calculates the length distribution, also contains visualisation

- `statistics.ipynb`: This script contains statistic tests used in analysis

- `pca.ipynb`: This script used to reduced demension and examined clusters using PCA and t-SNE models 

- `functiion.R`: This script to perform funcional analysis using e.g. clusterProfiler

- `adjustment.ipynb`: This script just to check some stuff
